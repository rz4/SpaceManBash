## Overview

SpaceManBash is a 2D Platformer with some combat elements.

This project was developed using Pygame for our CS498G Embedded Systems
course in order to learn more about the Python language.

## Game Features

SpaceManBash takes the player through 11 levels which will test their
platforming and hack&slashing skills. The player is tasked with reaching the
teleporter at the end of each level in order to progress through the game.

Some general features include:
- Modular Design
- Customizable Physics and Collisions
- Custom Level using JSON files
- Custom Level Scripts
- Some Custom Animations
- Music and Sounds
- Menu Systems
- Saving Game
